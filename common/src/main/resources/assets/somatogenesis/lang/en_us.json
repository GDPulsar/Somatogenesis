  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/discovery.description": "The monsters that appear at night are quite an interesting puzzle. What causes their life, and why are they so hostile? Perhaps I should pursue this further...",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/blood.description": "Blood is clearly a very good spot to start, as when I get hurt, I lose a lot of it. It seems that the monsters may want my blood, which begs the question of what I can do when I acquire it?",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/bone_tools.description": "The bones that Skeletons have seem to have some problems… Their lack of the rest of the body seems to have made them dormant. Despite that, these bones seem to form tools that increase the blood that monsters drop.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/blood_altar.description": "Blood has some interesting properties, but I can’t do anything with it on its own… I need to combine it with things, but I don’t have the stuff to do that. Maybe this will help?",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/blood_capsule.description": "These vials are much too small to hold all the blood I need… Surely this Blood Altar will give me the ability to make some better containers.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/bloodletting_1.description": "I seem to not be getting nearly as much blood as I was hoping. Despite dealing a lot of damage, these monsters only seem to be losing about a quarter of the blood they really have… Perhaps I can train my skills?",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/blood_gems_1.description": "Blood seems to interact with different materials in different ways… It almost seems to fill the gaps in cobblestone and merge with gems. These gems though… Something is different about how they interact with blood. It’s almost as if they mix, similar to the process of alloying. These may be important.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/basic_spells.description": "It seems that blood was much more than a simple liquid. It seems to have magical properties when combined with experience, allowing me to perform spells, as if I was a wizard! However, it seems that I’ll need to draw some specific shapes on the ground. Hopefully I get it right, or I’ll have wasted a lot of blood.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/spell_rune_hemorrhage.description": "It seems that I can increase blood flow within a monster’s vessels, causing a hemorrhage. This should not only cause damage for the monster, but increase the blood that I can acquire from the monster. It’s best to use this on a large monster though, as I might end up using more blood than I gain…",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/spell_rune_ignite.description": "I’m not entirely sure why, but it seems that the oxygen in blood allows me to cause a fire. I’m not sure where the fuel comes from, or where the spark is, but I can’t complain.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/evolution_research.description": "Through my various encounters with many different living beings, I have concluded that the weightlessness of an aquatic environment, as well as exposure to the sun’s radiation are important factors in evolution. Perhaps if I can recreate these environmental factors, I can create living creatures of my own?",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/evolutionary_mixture.description": "This seems to be the best combination of materials that I can formulate. With some water, large amounts of glowstone, a lot of blood and some blaze powder, I can create a solution that should accelerate the evolution of organisms. This substance, despite sounding so useful, is incredibly toxic. I should most definitely handle this with care, so maybe a bucket isn’t the greatest way to store it.",
  "progression.somatogenesis.phase1/evolution_tank.description": "This seems like the best way to create my own creatures. By creating a basic combination of all the components of life, I should be able to drown it in the Evolutionary Mixture and let it evolve into a living, breathing animal.",
